<h4>Design Elements</h4>
             Our visual identity is built around a simple yet intentional three-color palette.
             
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EFE1CF;"></span>
                  #EFE1CF
                  <em>  This is our base color, used as the background in most designs. It brings warmth, calmness, and a natural tone that reflects comfort and friendliness. Beige creates a neutral canvas that allows our accent colors to stand out while maintaining a soft, inviting aesthetic.</em>

                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #f15a28;"></span>
                  #F15A28
                  <em> One of the few colors that dogs can perceive, blue was selected for its practicality and emotional resonance. It symbolizes trust, reliability, and calmness, values that are at the heart of our brand. Blue also helps us connect with both pets and their owners on a deeper level.</em>
                </li><li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #56A4DA;"></span>
                  #56A4DA
                  <em> s the complementary color to blue, orange brings energy, enthusiasm, and warmth to our palette. It adds a playful, vibrant touch that contrasts beautifully with blue, creating a visually harmonious and balanced feel.</em>
                </li>
				  </ul>
				  <br>
				 <p> Together, these colors not only create a strong and consistent visual identity but also support the emotional tone we want to convey, joy, trust, and a sense of belonging for every member of our dog-loving community.</p>
				  <h5>Font choices</h5>
			  <p>The main font is called “snicker”. This font is playful and looks like it’s written with the hand. This gives an authentic and friendly look.</p> <p>The secondary font is Filson pro. This is a more simple font that is easily readable for larger pieces of text while still fitting within our style. It is a dynamic and modern font.</p>
				      <h4>Logo</h4>
		  <p>
The logo is made with a playful and fun font, and the letters are placed in a lively way to give it a cheerful and friendly look. Inside the logo, there are small details that show a paw and a tail. The tail starts from the end of the letter “s” and curls around playfully. The top of the letter“I” is shaped like a paw, which shows that dogs are a big part of what we do.</p> <p>These little touches make the logo feel warm, fun, and welcoming. It fits really well with our goal of bringing dogs and their owners together to play, connect, and enjoy time with others.
</p>
      <h4>Icons</h4>
		  <p> The icons we use are all connected to things that belong to dogs. For example, we use shapes like a paw, a nose, and bones. These dog-related elements help make the visual style more playful and clearly focused on dogs. They make it easy for people to see right away that our brand is all about dogs and their happiness.</p> <p>In our design, we also choose soft, round shapes instead of straight lines. Round shapes feel more friendly, gentle, and fun. They help create a warm and welcoming feeling, which fits perfectly with our brand’s goal, to build a kind, joyful place for dogs and their owners. Everything in our visual style, from the icons to the shapes, is made to support that friendly and playful feeling.</p>

       <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many dog owners struggle to connect with others in their neighborhood. Balancing work and pet care can be challenging, often leading to fewer social interactions for both owner and dog—especially in single-dog households where stimulation is limited.</li>
  <li>Finding suitable playmates is another issue. Owners may not know others open to dog interactions, especially if they have larger dogs, which can sometimes be seen as intimidating.</li>
  <li>Time constraints also play a role. Our target audience (ages 30–50) often works full-time, and short walks may not provide enough exercise or stimulation for their pets.</li>
  <li>Owners themselves often seek to expand their social circles. Meeting other dog lovers offers a way to build friendships while giving their dogs a chance to socialize.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>

We are committed to making the lives of dogs and their owners more social, joyful, and stress-free.

</ul>

<h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
<p>1. Assumption: Dog owners struggle to find local playmates for their dogs. We based this on the conversations with dog owners around us. Many said they didn’t know other owners nearby or weren’t sure if people were open to dog playdates, especially for larger dogs. This showed a clear need for a platform that makes those connections easier.</p>
<p>2. Assumption: Dog owners between 30–50 are open to using digital platforms. We shared our concept through Instagram and got positive reactions, especially from people in that age range. Flyers with QR codes also worked well, showing that our audience is digitally active and willing to try new solutions.</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Reflection on the Trademark “Happy Tails”</p>
<p>At first, our idea was to make a dog food website with healthy options and reviews. But we realized that emotional connection and community were stronger needs among dog owners. That insight led to our pivot toward social dog playdates.</p>
<p>We chose the name Happy Tails because it’s warm, memorable, and reflects joy, connection, and wagging tails, everything our platform stands for. Compared to names like PawPals or DogGo, Happy Tails felt more unique and emotionally fitting.</p>

<h4>Justification and validation of problem interviews</h4>
<p class="fw-bold">Problem interview and improvement value proposition Tess</p>
	

<p class="fw-bold">Conclusion</p>
<p>It is evident from the first interview with Lisa Wahl, wishing her dog Bo had further walks and mingling with other dogs while she was at work. Happy tails can fix her problems of limited access for dog sitters, dog playmates and walkers that are reliable and trustworthy. Happy tails will thoroughly make sure any person on the website has security checks and measures such as Uber does for instance which would solve the one problem Lisa has with connecting with strangers to take care of Bo. As dog sitters are expensive and walkers are too, here at happy tails we provide Lisa with convenience, affordable care for her dog Bo and create a healthier routine for her dog on the daily.</p> 

<p class="fw-bold">Results and business pivot </p>

Happy tails originally was meant to be a dog food company, providing healthy alternative diets best suited for each breed of dog, after conducting our interviews, we didn't get much of a demand for food services from the patient results. Instead through survey analysis we found a greater demand for sourcing reliable dog sitters, dog walkers and playmate services. The common denominator was that dog owners like Lisa Wahl worked a lot and only  had little time of the day to walk their dog, thus feeling guilty and wanting their dog to have quality life experiences that are affordable and convenient for people in a time crunch. Here the Happy Tails website is a reliable and safe platform that allows these needs to be met for both dogs and their owners. 

<p class="fw-bold">Detailed conclusion form interviews</p>
				<p class="fw-bold">Customers job</p>
<p>The customers' jobs would be to source our happy tails website and find a suitable dog sitter, walker or playmate there. For security and comfortability purposes the dog owner and worker will meet up prior with their dog to see if it's a good fit. Anyone with an account on the website can apply to be a dog caretaker with whichever services or can only receive services by choice.</p>
				  
<p class="fw-bold">Pains</p>
<p>One pain that could arise from our website and services is that the owner lacks comfortability with their sitter, or that there is a lack of communication between service providers and seekers. Although there is security, just like uber sometimes there can be bad people that get reported.</p>
				  
<p class="fw-bold">Gains and Gain Creators </p>

    <h4>Problem interview and improvement value proposition 2 Tess</h4>			 

	<p class="fw-bold">Analysis</p>			

<p>Phoenix and his dog Arlo’s interview analysis had the same demand for dog walking, dog sitting and dog playmates as did Lisa wahl in the previous interview. The common denominator was that people have busy lives and want to prioritize their dog but all services are way too expensive and time consuming. Happy tails solves all these issues as the dog sitter and walker would come to your home for pick up and worry free, while it provides convenience as the website has all three common concerns of dog sitting, walkers and lack of playmates in one place to source out help to. </p>

<p>Based on this interview, we were able to pivot our original idea of a healthy dog food company to ‘Happy Tails,’ a website for socialization and connection between dog owners.</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Problem interview and improvement value proposition - Amy</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Conclusion</p>
<p>Jerry, 49, owns Spike, a high-energy American Staffordshire-Labrador mix. Due to time constraints, he won’t get another dog. His routine includes work, midday walks, and weekend socialization for Spike.</p>
<p>Spike gets along with big dogs but dislikes small ones. Jerry avoids on-leash interactions due to past training advice, limiting Spike’s socialization. He struggles to coordinate meet-ups but wishes for an app to arrange walks and playdates. Managing Spike’s jumping is challenging, and he hopes time will help. Family assists with walks, and a boarding service might be needed for vacations. A dog-owner network for sitting and playdates would be useful.</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Results and business pivot</p>

<p>We initially planned a website for purchasing dog food, but through interviews, we discovered that most dog owners were satisfied with their current suppliers. This led us to shift our focus and explore the daily challenges they faced with their pets. A key insight emerged: many single-pet households struggle with limited interaction between their dogs and others in the neighborhood. Based on this finding, we pivoted our idea towards facilitating local dog meetups to foster socialization and community among pet owners.</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Detailed conclusion from interviews</p>
<p class="fw-bold">Customers' job</p>
<p>Many dog owners want to find playmates for their dogs and meet new people. They are looking for ways to connect with others who are open to meet-ups and want to know where in their neighborhood these opportunities are available.</p>


<p class="fw-bold">Pains</p>
<p>Many dog owners struggle to connect with others in their neighborhood, limiting socialization opportunities for their dogs. Single-dog households, especially those with larger dogs that may be perceived as intimidating, face additional challenges in finding playmates. Time constraints can make it difficult for full-time workers to provide enough exercise and stimulation for their dogs. At the same time, dog owners are also seeking ways to meet new people who share their interests, trying to balance a social life with pet care responsibilities.</p>

<p class="fw-bold">Gains</p>
<p>Happy Tails connects dog owners in their neighborhood for walks and playdates. The platform helps users find like-minded dog owners nearby, allowing dogs to socialize while owners relax and chat. It provides a safe, trusted space for dogs and owners to interact without the hassle of finding companions.

<p class="fw-bold">Final thoughts</p>
<p> Jerry’s interview revealed that Spike, his dog, requires more stimulation beyond his daily walks.

She’s open to a website that connects dog owners for playdates and sitting, as long as it includes info about both dogs and owners, like size, energy level, and routines.</p> 
<p>Trust is key for her, she would want to chat first and possibly meet before arranging anything. She believes her dog would really benefit from more social contact through such a service.</p>

<p> Mirabel, like many dog owners, wants more social interaction for her dog and for herself. She’s looking for easy ways to connect with local dog owners for meetups, especially since her dog doesn’t often get the chance to play with others. She values trust and convenience in any solution that helps her manage her responsibilities while giving her dog a better social life.</p>
				  
<p class="fw-bold">Pains</p>
<p>Mirabel struggles to find fenced dog areas in her city (Alkmaar), which limits off-leash play. Her husky doesn't do well with small dogs, so finding compatible playmates is challenging. With both her and her partner working, the dog is often home alone for 5–6 hours a day. She often has to plan her day around the dog’s schedule, which can limit her freedom. She doesn’t use any pet care services currently and finds it hard to trust strangers with her dog.

It would also connect her to other owners with similar routines and mindsets, making it feel more like a trusted community than just a service. This platform would offer her peace of mind and a break from constantly juggling dog care with personal plans..</p>

<p>Happy Tails offers easy access to local dog owners, eliminating the strFilters to match dogs by size and energy level would help avoid mismatches, such as Mirabel’s husky being paired with much smaller dogs.

A shared calendar or availability system would make it easier for her to find meetups that fit her busy schedule. Additionally, including owner bios allows her to feel more comfortable and informed about the people she’s connecting with.</p>
