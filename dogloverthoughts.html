        <p>This past weekend Happy Tails hosted one of our biggest dog meet-ups yet.</p>
        <p>Over 50 dogs gathered at Breda’s beautiful park, ready to make new fur-iends. From tiny Chihuahuas to goofy Golden Retrievers, every pup had a blast romping around and socializing. There were zoomies, play bows, and yes, some impressive synchronized tail wagging!</p>

        <p>Happy Tails is officially crossing borders; we’ve launched in Belgium! That means even more dogs finding playmates, owners swapping tips, and new friendships forming across parks, cafes, and walking trails.</p>
        <p>To celebrate, we hosted our very first Belgian meet-up in Antwerp, where over 30 dogs came together for an afternoon of fun. Whether they were playing fetch, sniffing out new friends, or begging for extra treats.</p>

        <p>If you thought puppy energy was unstoppable, try gathering 20 puppies in one place. It’s next-level adorable chaos! Last weekend, Happy Tails hosted an exclusive puppy social for our youngest members.</p>
        <p>From clumsy paws to mini zoomies, these pups had the time of their lives learning how to socialize, share toys, and almost sit still for a group photo. Owners got to swap training tips, share laughs over puppy antics.</p>

        <p>Who said playdates are just for dogs? At Happy Tails, we’re seeing more and more owners forming friendships just as strong as their pups’!</p>
        <p>Take Lisa and Tom, who met through the app while setting up a playdate for their dogs, Luna and Charlie. Fast forward a few months, and not only are Luna and Charlie inseparable, but Lisa and Tom are now best friends too—meeting up regularly for dog walks, coffee, and even a weekend getaway.</p>
